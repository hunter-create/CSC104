In my index.html file it outputs a screen in darker grey color with a navbar, a footer, 3 images and some white header and paragraph text.
the rest of the pages are currently not filled in but are there to add some more context to what will be on the page and how the css is across mutliple html pages and how 
the navbar takes you to all of those pages and back.
